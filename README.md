# Homehealth

Industry challenge organised by BrainStation and Google, to improve accessibility to healthcare services through education and digital solutions.

Working in collaboration with teams from UX Design and Data Science we designed and built a proof of concept for an accessible üì±app to book doctor visits for patients with mobility impairment. 

Our team came up with a [prototype](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D38FVtD94oJFTStvuw3N3tSF0iwZl7ql/view?usp=sharing) in just 24 hours and our solution was selected as the winnerüèÜ

*Note: this is not the final product, rather a mobile prototype*
